# Java Math Operations Program

This Java program demonstrates the usage of various math functions using the `java.lang.Math` class. The program takes a user-inputted number and applies the following mathematical operations:

- **Math.floor()**: Rounds a number down to the nearest integer.
- **Math.ceil()**: Rounds a number up to the nearest integer.
- **Math.min()**: Compares two numbers and returns the smaller value.
- **Math.pow()**: Calculates one number raised to the power of another.
- **Math.abs()**: Returns the absolute value of a number.
- **Math.round()**: Rounds a number to the nearest integer.

## Features
- Interactive console-based input and output.
- Demonstrates core Java Math operations.
- Provides clear and formatted results.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher.

## Usage
1. Enter a number when prompted.
2. View the calculated results for the various Math operations.

## Example Output
```
Enter a number: -4.7
Floor: -5.0
Ceil: -4.0
Min (with comparison to 0): -4.7
Pow (number^2): 22.09
Absolute: 4.7
Rounded: -5
```
